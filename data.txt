Gy\u016btan was originally conceived to be flavored with salt, which led to gy\u016btan being called tanshio (\u30bf\u30f3\u5869?, lit. \"tongue salt\") in many yakiniku restaurants. However, some stores now serve gy\u016btan with tare sauce.", "Gy\u016btan was created when Sano Keishir\u014d, the owner of a yakitori restaurant in Sendai, opened a new restaurant that served cow tongue dishes in 1948. This restaurant was called Tasuke (\u592a\u52a9), and is still considered one of the best places to eat gy\u016btan in Sendai. Sano decided to open this restaurant to use cow tongues and tails left over by occupation forces, which were stationed in Sendai after Japan was defeated in World War II. Gy\u016btan was initially considered a rather unusual dish, but gradually gained popularity throughout Japan, partially because white collar workers who were transferred from Sendai spread its reputation to other cities.", "Gy\u016btan restaurants received a boost in 1991, when Japan's import quotas for beef were eliminated. In 2003, the Japanese government temporarily banned American beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered in the country. This was a devastating blow for many gy\u016btan restaurants. For example, 90% of the beef tongues used in gy\u016btan restaurants in Sendai were imported from the U.S. Additionally, some connoisseurs claim that U.S. beef contains the ideal amount of fat for gy\u016btan dishes and refuse to use Australian beef.", "Much of the content of this article comes from the equivalent Japanese-language Wikipedia article (retrieved September 21, 2005).

There are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.", "", "", "The term hamburger originally derives from Hamburg, Germany's second largest city. In High German, Burg means \"fortified settlement\" or \"fortified refuge\" and is a widespread component of place names.

The earliest known report in a newspaper is from July 5, 1896, when the Chicago Daily Tribune made a highly specific claim regarding a \"hamburger sandwich\" in an article about a \"Sandwich Car\": \"A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range.\" According to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the hamburger, a ground meat patty between two slices of bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. There have been rival claims by Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher David. White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase. However, it gained national recognition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the New York Tribune referred to the hamburger as \"the innovation of a food vendor on the pike\". No conclusive argument has ever ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: \"One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country.\"", "Louis Lassen of Louis' Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New Haven, Connecticut, is said to have sold the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1900. New York magazine states that \"The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later\", noting also that this claim is subject to dispute. A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast. Some critics like Josh Ozersky, a food editor for New York Magazine, claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.", "One of the earliest claims comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair. The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as \"Hamburger Charlie\", with the invention. Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.", "According to White Castle, Otto Kuase was the inventor of the hamburger. In 1891 he created a beef patty cooked in butter and topped with a fried egg. German sailors would later omit the fried egg.", "The family of Oscar Weber Bilby claim the first-known hamburger on a bun was served on July 4, 1891 on Grandpa Oscar's farm. The bun was a yeast bun. In 1995, Governor Frank Keating proclaimed that the first true hamburger on a bun was created and consumed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1891, calling Tulsa, \"The Real Birthplace of the Hamburger.\"", "Frank and Charles Menches claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in 1885 in Hamburg, New York. During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef. Kunzog[who?], who spoke to Frank Menches, says they exhausted their supply of sausage, so purchased chopped up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein. Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market not Klein's, despite Stein's having sold the market in 1874. The story notes that the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York not Hamburg Germany. Frank Menches's obituary in The New York Times states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in Akron, Ohio.", "Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas claimed to have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories, in the 1880s he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a 'burger' of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread, with a pickle on the side. The story is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World's Fair. Historian Frank X. Tolbert, noted that Athen's resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with 'Old Dave' a.k.a. Fletcher Davis.

Accordingly, Western sources generally maintain that ph\u1edf is derived from pot-au-feu in both name and substance. However, various scholars dispute this etymology on the basis of the stark differences between the two dishes. Ironically, pho in French has long been pronounced [fo] rather than [f\u00f8] (it sounds more flat with Vietnamese)[clarification needed]: in Jean Tardieu's Lettre de Hano\u00ef \u00e0 Roger Martin Du Gard (1928), a soup vendor cries \"Pho-\u00f4!\" in the street.", "Many Hanoians explain that the word ph\u1edf derives from French soldiers' ordering \"feu\" (fire) from g\u00e1nh ph\u1edf, referring to both the steam rising from a bowl of pho and the wood fire seen glowing from a g\u00e1nh ph\u1edf in the evening.", "Food historian Erica J.

Elucidating on the 1931 dictionary, Gouin and L\u00ea Ng\u1ecdc Tr\u1ee5 (1970) both give l\u1ee5c ph\u1edf as a corruption of ng\u01b0u nh\u1ee5c ph\u1ea5n (Chinese: \u725b\u8089\u7c89; Cantonese Yale: ngau4 yuk6 fan2; literally: \"cow meat noodles\"), which was commonly sold by Chinese immigrants in Hanoi.", "Some scholars argue that pho (the dish) evolved from x\u00e1o tr\u00e2u, a Vietnamese dish common in Hanoi at the turn of the century. Originally eaten by commoners near the Red River, it consisted of stir-fried strips of water buffalo meat served in broth atop rice vermicelli. Around 1908\u20131909, the shipping industry brought an influx of laborers. Vietnamese and Chinese cooks set up g\u00e1nh to serve them x\u00e1o tr\u00e2u but later switched to inexpensive scraps of beef set aside by butchers who sold to the French. Chinese vendors advertised this x\u00e1o b\u00f2 by crying out, \"Beef and noodles!\" (Cantonese Yale: ngau4 yuk6 fan2; Vietnamese: ng\u01b0u nh\u1ee5c ph\u1ea5n). Eventually the street cry became \"Meat and noodles!\" (Chinese: \u8089\u7c89; Cantonese Yale: yuk6 fan2; Vietnamese: nh\u1ee5c ph\u1ea5n), with the last syllable elongated. Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc B\u00edch suggests that the final \"n\" was eventually dropped because ph\u1ea5n could mean \"excrement\". The French author Jean Marquet refers to the dish as \"Yoc feu!\" in his 1919 novel Du village-\u00e0-la cit\u00e9. This is likely what the Vietnamese poet T\u1ea3n \u0110\u00e0 calls \"nh\u1ee5c-ph\u1edf\" in \"\u0110\u00e1nh b\u1ea1c\" (\"Gambling\"), written around 1915\u20131917.", "Pho is served in a bowl with a specific cut of white rice noodles in clear beef broth, with slim cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket).

For a more intense flavor, the bones may still have beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.", "The spices, often wrapped in cheesecloth or soaking bag to prevent them from floating all over the pot, usually contain: clove, star anise, coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger and onion.", "Careful cooks often roast ginger and onion over an open fire for about a minute before adding them to the stock, to bring out their full flavor.

Prior to refrigeration technology, this style of cooking enabled preservation of the large amount of meat. Rendang is rich in spices. Along with the main meat ingredient, rendang uses coconut milk (Minangkabau: karambia) and a paste of mixed ground spices, which includes ginger, galangal, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, garlic, shallot, chilli and other spices. This spice mixture is called \u2018pemasak\u2019 in Minangkabau. The spices, garlic, shallot, ginger and galangal used in rendang have antimicrobial properties and serve as natural organic preservatives. If cooked properly, dry rendang can last for as long as four weeks.", "Traditional Padang rendang takes hours to cook. Cooking rendang involves pounding and grinding ingredients as well as slow cooking, and so is time-consuming and requires patience. The meat pieces are slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices until almost all the liquid is gone, allowing the meat to absorb the condiments. The cooking process changes from boiling to frying as the liquid evaporates. The slow cooking process allows the meat to absorb all the spices and become tender. To cook the meat until tender with almost all the liquid evaporated requires great care, if the meat is not to be burnt or be spoilt. Because of its generous use of numerous spices, rendang is known for having a complex and unique taste.", "Rendang is often served with steamed rice, ketupat (a compressed rice cake) or lemang (glutinous rice cooked in bamboo tubes), accompanied with vegetable side dishes such as boiled cassava leaf, cubadak (young jackfruit gulai), cabbage gulai and lado (red or green chilli pepper sambal).", "The early process of cooking rendang, the coconut milk is still abundant", "Mid process of rendang cooking, coconut milk start to evaporate and become oily", "Rendang almost ready, coconut milk almost evaporated completely and the meat darkened", "Rendang ready to serve", "Rendang served with nasi rames (steamed rice, cabbage gulai, green sambal and gulai sauce)", "Rendang is revered in Minangkabau culture as an embodiment of the philosophy of musyawarah, discussion and consultation with elders.

One of the earliest written records of rendang is from the early 16th century Hikayat Amir Hamzah. The making of rendang spreads from Minangkabau region to Mandailing, Riau, Jambi, across the strait to Malacca and Negeri Sembilan, resulting in a variety of rendang traditions.", "The popularity of rendang has spread widely from its original domain because of the merantau (migrating) culture of Minangkabau people. Overseas Minangkabau leave their home town to start a career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighbouring countries, and Padang restaurants, Minangkabau eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularised rendang and other Padang food dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.", "Andalas University historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants and migrant workers began to trade and migrate to Malacca in the 16th century. \u2018Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for long journey.\u2019 The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature.", "In Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: Gulai \u2014 Kalio \u2014 Rendang. The ingredients of gulai, kalio and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that gulai usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.", "If pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called \u2018gulai\u2019. If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called \u2018kalio\u2019. For a traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the colour turns to a dark brown, almost black colour. Thus not only liquid content but also colour indicate which type of rendang is involved: gulai is light yellow, kalio is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.", "According to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended and cooked for hours until the coconut milk evaporated and the meat absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honour guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored in room temperature and still good to consume. It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.", "Wet rendang, more accurately identified as \u2018kalio\u2019, is a type of rendang that is cooked for a shorter period of time and much of the coconut milk liquid has not evaporated. If stored at room temperature, kalio lasts less than a week. Kalio usually has a light golden brown colour, paler than dry rendang.", "Outside of its native land in Minangkabau, rendang is also known in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Most Malaysian rendang is more like kalio, lighter in colour and taste when compared with its Minangkabau counterpart. Malaysian rendang has several variants, such as Kelantan rendang and Negeri Sembilan rendang. Malaysian styles of rendang are typically cooked for shorter periods, and use kerisik (toasted grated coconut) to thicken the spice, instead of stirring over a low heat for many hours to evaporate the coconut milk as Indonesian rendang requires. Nonetheless, in Malaysia the rendang Tok variant, found in the state of Perak, is a dry one.", "Other ethnic groups in Indonesia also have adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example, in Java, other than Padang rendang sold in Padang restaurants, the Javanese cooked a wet rendang, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate Javanese tastes. Through colonial ties the Dutch are also familiar with rendang and often serve the wet kalio version in the Netherlands \u2014 usually as part of a rijsttafel.", "Rendang is made from beef (or occasionally beef liver, chicken, mutton, water buffalo, duck, or vegetables like jackfruit or cassava). Chicken or duck rendang also contains tamarind and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.", "The original Indonesian-Minangkabau rendang has two categories, rendang darek and rendang pesisir. Rendang darek (\u2018land rendang\u2019) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of Minangkabau such as Batusangkar, Agam, Lima Puluh Kota, Payakumbuh, Padang Panjang and Bukittinggi. It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products which are found in these places. Rendang pesisir (\u2018coastal rendang\u2019) is from the coastal regions of Minangkabau such as Pariaman, Padang, Painan and Pasaman.

In 1865, he was able to convince the posh Maxwell House Hotel to add it to their winter menu, and from there it gained in popularity, attracting other meat-packing companies to emulate his success.", "At one time, there were over 30 butchers and meat-packers in Nashville, and nearly all of them produced Spice Round. Each used a slightly different and closely guarded recipe.", "Nashville's version of Rinderbraten was not stuffed with pork fat; rather, it was larded throughout the meat with special horns. In addition to the fat being blended with the traditional Rinderbraten spice, typically the same spices would be used in the brining solution and run through the meat using specially prepared larding needles, leading to a much more heavily spiced preparation than the German version.

Another theory of the name \"sukiyaki\" is from the word \"sukimi\", which means \"thinly cut meat\" in Japanese. However, sukiyaki became a traditional Japanese dish during the Meiji era (1868-1912). The second allusion is the history of sukiyaki. Buddhism was introduced to Japan around Edo period, killing or eating livestock is against Buddhist law at that time. Therefore, eating beef was prohibited due to cattle were main labor animals. However, people could eat meat under some special circumstances such as when they were sick or having special events to celebrate like b\u014dnenkai, a Japanese year-end drinking party. In the 1860s when Japan opened its port, foreigners who came to Japan introduced the culture of eating meat and new cooking styles. Cows, milk, meat, and eggs became widely used, and sukiyaki was the most popular way to serve them. At the beginning, cattle was imported from neighboring countries like Korea and China as the demand of beef went up. Later, until the Meiji Era, eating meat is no longer prohibited. And sukiyaki became popular in Kansai region. Because of 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, lots of beef restaurants in Tokyo were closed, and the people of Kant\u014d temporarily moved to the Osaka area. While the people of Kant\u014d were in Osaka, they got accustomed to the Kansai style of sukiyaki, and when they returned to Kant\u014d, they introduced the Kansai sukiyaki style, where it has since become popular.

The 16th century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pulao. It states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India. A similar theory - that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion - also appears to be incorrect, because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period. There are references to a dish of \"fried\" rice, flavoured with various aromatic spices and condiments in ancient texts of India, which were enjoyed by the ruling classes.

Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary. Lizzie Collingham states that the modern biryani was created in the Mughal kitchen, as a confluence of the Persian pilau and the spicy rice dishes of India. According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Calicut (Kozhikode) in South India.", "Pilaf or pulao, as it is known in the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in Indian cuisine. Although some of its varieties are associated with Persian influence in northern India, it is also mentioned in ancient Hindu texts such as Yagnavalkya Smriti.

Jules Gouff\u00e9 presents roebuck cutlets \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale and broiled sweetbreads \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale in The royal cookery book (1867). Charles Elm\u00e9 Francatelli provides fish recipes \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale in The Modern Cook (1859). The latter book also includes recipes for a rabbit \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale filled with duxelles and a fowl fillet \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale stuffed with truffles and herbs. A similar filet de poulets \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale with herbs and forcemeat is also found in La cuisine classique by Urbain Dubois (1868). In contrast, chicken supr\u00eames \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale mentioned by August Escoffier in Le guide culinaire are not stuffed. Elena Molokhovets' A Gift to Young Housewives, the most successful Russian cookbook of the 19th century, has included since its first edition in 1861 an elaborate recipe for grouze \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale stuffed with madeira sauce with champignons and truffles.", "The Russian Tea Room Cookbook notes that Chicken Kiev was \"most likely ... a creation of the great French chef Car\u00eame at the Court of Alexander I.\" Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame spent just several months of the year 1818 in St. Petersburg, but made a profound impact on Russian cuisine at this short time.

The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.", "", "", "Generally, chickens are not fried whole; instead, the chicken is divided into its four main constituent pieces: the two white meat sections are the breast and the wing from the front of the chicken, while the dark meat sections are the thigh and leg or \"drumstick\", are from the rear of the chicken. To prepare the chicken pieces for frying, they are dredged in flour or a similar dry substance (possibly following marination or dipping in milk or buttermilk) to coat the meat and to develop a crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. Traditionally, lard is used to fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil are also frequently used. The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use.", "There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting. Pan frying (or shallow frying) requires a frying pan of sturdy construction and a source of fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces have been added to the hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy. Chicken Maryland is made when the pan of chicken pieces, and fat, is placed in the oven to cook, for a majority of the overall cooking time, basically \"fried in the oven\".", "Deep frying requires a deep fryer or other device in which the chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The pieces are floured as above or battered using a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can/may contain ingredients like eggs, milk, and leavening. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.", "Broasting uses a pressure cooker to accelerate the process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in a pressure cooker. Chicken pieces are then floured or battered and then placed in the hot fat. The lid is placed on the pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.", "Fritters have existed in Europe since the middle ages. The Scots, and later Scottish immigrants to the southern United States, had a tradition of deep frying chicken in fat, unlike their English counterparts who baked or boiled chicken.", "A number of West African cuisines featured dishes where chicken was fried, typically in palm oil, sometimes having been battered before. These would be served on special occasions in some areas, or sometimes sold in the streets as snacks in others. This provided some means of independent economy for enslaved and segregated African American women, who became noted sellers of poultry (live or cooked) as early as the 1730s. Because of this and the expensive nature of the ingredients, it was, despite popular perception, a rare and special dish in the African-American community.", "After the development of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century, in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and in a relatively short period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.", "When it was introduced to the American South, fried chicken became a common staple. Later, as the slave trade led to Africans being brought to work on southern plantations, the slaves who became cooks incorporated seasonings and spices that were absent in traditional Scottish cuisine, enriching the flavor. Since most slaves were unable to raise expensive meats, but generally allowed to keep chickens, frying chicken on special occasions continued in the African American communities of the South. It endured the fall of slavery and gradually passed into common use as a general Southern dish. Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather before refrigeration was commonplace, it gained further favor in the periods of American history when segregation closed off most restaurants to the black population. Fried chicken continues to be among this region's top choices for \"Sunday dinner\" among both blacks and whites. Holidays such as Independence Day and other gatherings often feature this dish.", "Since the American Civil War, traditional slave foods like fried chicken, watermelon, and chitterlings have suffered a strong association with African American stereotypes and blackface minstrelsy. This was commercialized for the first half of the 20th century by restaurants like Sambo's and Coon Chicken Inn, which selected exaggerated depictions of blacks as mascots, implying quality by their association with the stereotype. Although also being acknowledged positively as \"soul food\" today, the affinity that African American culture has for fried chicken has been considered a delicate, often pejorative issue. While the perception of fried chicken as an ethnic dish has been fading for several decades, with the ubiquity of fried chicken dishes in the US, it persists as a racial stereotype.", "Before the industrialization of chicken production, and the creation of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried. (This method is common in Australia.) Another method is to fry the chicken pieces using a pan fried method. The chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid, usually, a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in. This process (of flouring, frying and simmering in gravy) is known as \"smothering\" and can be used for other tough cuts of meat, such as swiss steak. Smothered chicken is still consumed today, though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens, or who seek out stewing hens, it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens.", "The derivative phrases \"country fried\" and \"chicken fried\" often refer to other foods prepared in the manner of fried chicken. Usually, this means a boneless, tenderized piece of meat that has been floured or battered and cooked in any of the methods described above or simply chicken which is cooked outdoors. Chicken fried steak and \"country fried\" boneless chicken breast are two common examples.", "Throughout the world, different seasoning and spices are used to augment the flavor of fried chicken. Because of the versatility of fried chicken, it is not uncommon to flavor the chicken's crisp exterior with a variety of spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.", "In the United States, fried chicken has stereotypically been associated with African Americans.

Peng was the Nationalist government banquets' chef and fled with Chiang Kai-shek's forces to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. There, he continued his career as official chef until 1973, when he moved to New York to open a restaurant. That was where Peng Jia started inventing new dishes and modifying traditional ones; one new dish, General Tso's chicken, was originally prepared without sugar, and subsequently altered to suit the tastes of \"non-Hunanese people\". The popularity of the dish has now led to it being \"adopted\" by local Hunanese chefs and food writers, perhaps as an acknowledgment of the dish's unique status, upon which the international reputation of Hunanese cuisine was largely based. Ironically, when Peng Jia opened a restaurant in Hunan in the 1990s introducing General Tso's chicken, the restaurant closed without success and the locals found the dish too sweet.", "Peng's Restaurant on East 44th Street in New York City claims that it was the first restaurant in the city to serve General Tso's chicken.

Older chefs argue that the rice was originally shaped into balls because it needed to be kept warm from the time it was cooked (often earlier in the day) until mealtime. The rice balls, when stored in wooden containers, apparently stayed warm for a longer time. The other theory is that the rice balls were more portable and were easier for labourers working on plantations to transport from home.

She has operated the restaurant since 1980; before that time, it was owned by her great-uncle, Thornton Prince.

The word jerk refers to the spice rub,wet marinade, and to the particular cooking technique. Jerk cooking has developed a following in US and Western European cosmopolitan urban centers with Caribbean/West Indian communities.[citation needed]", "One theory is that Jamaican jerk sauce is actually African since the origins of jerk pork can be traced back to the pre-slavery days of the Coromantee hunters of West Africa. When the British invaded Jamaica in 1655 the Spanish colonists fled, leaving behind a large number of African slaves. Rather than be re-enslaved by the British, they escaped into Jamaica's mountainous regions where they mixed in with the local Ta\u00ednos.[citation needed]", "Though Jamaican jerk sauce certainly was derived from African ancestry, it is something that was adapted and modified over hundreds of years as various cultures added their influence. From the start, changes had to be made since the Coromantee slaves found themselves in new surroundings on the island of Jamaica and were forced to use what was available to them.[citation needed]", "As a result, there was naturally a departure from some of the original spices used in jerk and new ingredients were added or substituted as necessary. One new addition to the recipe was the Scotch bonnet pepper, which is largely responsible for the heat found in Caribbean jerks.[citation needed]", "The cooking technique of jerking, as well as the results it produces, has evolved over time from using pit fires to old oil barrel halves as the container of choice. Around the 1960s, Caribbean entrepreneurs seeking to recreate the smoked pit flavor in an easier, more portable method came up with a solution to cut oil barrels lengthwise and attach hinges, drilling several ventilation holes for the smoke. These barrels are fired with charcoal, which enhances the spicy, smoky taste. Alternatively, when these cooking methods are unavailable, other methods of meat smoking, including wood burning ovens, can be used to jerk meat. However, oil barrels are arguably one of the most popular cooking methods for making jerk in Jamaica. Most jerk in Jamaica is no longer cooked in the traditional method and is grilled over hardwood charcoal in a steel drum jerk pan.[citation needed]", "Street-side jerk stands or jerk centers are frequently found in Jamaica and the nearby Cayman Islands, as well as throughout the Caribbean diaspora and beyond. Jerked meat, usually chicken or pork, can be purchased along with hard dough bread, deep fried cassava bammy (flatbread, usually with fish), Jamaican fried dumplings (known as Johnny or journey cakes), and festival, a variation of sweet flavored fried dumplings made with sugar and served as a side.[citation needed]", "Jerk cooking and seasoning has followed the Caribbean diaspora all over the world, and forms of jerk can now be found at restaurants almost anywhere a significant population of Caribbean descent exists, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, or the United States.

In some parts of Japan, large numbers of yakitori-ya can sometimes be found clustered together in one street or alley. Tokyo's Omoide-yokocho in Shinjuku is one particularly famous example. Yakitori is a type of grilled chicken that is skewered. The chicken is usually grilled on charcoal and a small skewer is put through it, similar to a chicken satay. It is then dressed in a traditional japanese sauce or salt. It is especially popular in Japan, but is also popular in China and South Korea. Yakitori is considered a street food. There are rows of vendors selling the food! People usually order the food during the evening, which is the most popular time to eat the food.", "", "", "Yakitori is made with several bite-sized pieces of chicken meat, or chicken offal, mounted on a bamboo skewer and grilled, usually over binch\u014dtan charcoal.", "Diners ordering yakitori usually have a choice of having it cooked with salt (shio), or with tare sauce, which is generally made up of mirin, sake, soy sauce and sugar. The sauce is applied to the skewered meat which is grilled until delicately cooked.", "These are not \"yakitori\" per se being something other than chicken. Both yakitori and these skewered dishes are more correctly referred to as \"kushiyaki.\"", "Left to right: Kawa (chicken skin); yamaimo; shishit\u014d", "Chicken liver", "Left to right: Asparagus wrapped in thinly sliced pork, with chicken wing yakitori", "Ginkgo nuts", "Left to right: Tsukune; negi (scallion) and butabara (pork belly)", "Negima (chicken thigh and scallion)", "\"Udon Noodles.\" Udon Noodles.
